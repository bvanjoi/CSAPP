C also provides a set of **logical operations**: ||, &&, ~, which correspond to the OR, AND, NOT.

These can easily be confused with the *bit-level operations*, but their behavior is quite different.

The logical operations return either 1 or 0 in C language, indicating a result of either *true* or *false* respectively.
