# Storage Technologies

- RAM: random access memory.

| | Transistors per bit | Relative access time | Persistent | Sensitive | Relative cost | Applications |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| SRAM | 6 | 1x | yes | no | 1000x  | Cache memory |
| DRAM | 1 | 10x | no | yes | 1x | Main memory, frame buffers|

DRAMs and SRAMs are **volatile** in the sense that they lose their information if the supply voltage is turned off.

- Nonvolatile Memory:
  - Rom: read-only memory. but even though some types of ROMs can be written to as well as read. For example: PROM, programmable ROM; EPRROM, erasable programmable ROM; EEPROM, electrically erasable PROM;
  - Flash memory, based on  EEPROMs.
  - SSD, solid state disk.

- Accessing Main Memory
  - bus: data flows back and forth between the processor and the DRAM main memory over shared electrical conduits called buses.

- Disk: disks are workhorse storage devices that hold enormous amounts of data.

**DRAM and disk performance are lagging behind CPU performance**.
