# The Importance of Abstractions in Computer System

The use of abstractions is one of the most important concepts in computer science.

Foe example:

- API(application program interface): a set of functions that allow programmers to use the code without having to delve into its inner workings. Such as Java class and C function prototypes.
- abstractions in computer systems: 1. **instruction set architecture** provides an abstraction of the actual processor hardware, with this abstraction, a machine-code program behaves as if it were executed on a processor that performs just one instruction at a time. 2. **files** as an abstraction of I/O devices; 3. **virtual memory** as an abstraction of program memory; 4. **virtual machine** providing an abstraction of the entire computer, including the operating system, the processor, and the programs.
